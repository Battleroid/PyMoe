# PyMoe
Welcome to PyMoe, the only python lib you'll ever need if you need the animu/mangu on the python platform.

# Status
As it stands, I'm working on each platform independently. Right now, Hummingbird is done and ready for use. Please find details below.

## Hummingbird
Ready to use as of version 0.1.
To create an instance do:
```python
import Pymoe
instance = Pymoe.Hummingbird()
```
It has 3 interfaces to it: Anime, Library and User.
